This template was implemented so modded blocks can be easily added without having the risk of vanilla blocks being edited and one can easily see which mods are already supported as different mods are in different lines. 

## Documentating Changes
Once you've added your blocks, please go to addedMods.md and add what mod you've added with the appropriate status following this template.

## Version
- Each property file has an independent version system which increases when a vanilla component has been changed, it does not increase when the community has added modded entries
- The properties files will always be up-to-date with the Euphoria Patches dev versions
